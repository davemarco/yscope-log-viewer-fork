# Overview

The log viewer offers two ways to filter log levels.

## Severity Filtering
Filter logs at or above a selected level. Click the level name (e.g., INFO) to show all logs at
 or above that severity. For example, selecting INFO shows INFO, WARN, ERROR, and FATAL logs.

## Individual Filtering
Select specific log levels to show or hide. Use the checkboxes next to each level name to toggle
 visibility.
