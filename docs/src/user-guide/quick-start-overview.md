# Overview

This guide shows you how to open local and remote log files.

## Local Files
To open a local file, use the folder icon (üìÅ) in the top-left corner. This will open a file
browser where you can navigate to and select your log file.

## Remote Files
To open a remote file, append `/?filePath=<FILE_URL>` to the current URL. Just replace
 `<FILE_URL>` with the URL of your log file.
